Example Git Remote Helper
=========================
This is an example `Git remote helper` implementing the `push` and `fetch`
capabilities.

As a basic introduction to the idea of Git remote helpers, the official
documentation [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote-helpers] can be useful.
However, in order to program a working helper, one must have a deeper
understanding of Git's internals since the documentation omits many details.
Actual implementations of remote helpers, that can be found over the
Internet, are often built for various cloud services so gaining a basic
idea how to implement a new helper is kind of difficult.

This script is a result of my own painful studying the subject. It implements
a "remote" storage in another directory on the local file system. For purpose
of study, it simply transfers all the objects file by file. However, this
approach would be an overkill when transferring data over the Internet.
In such cases, implementing some kind of packing and transferring the whole
packs would be a much better way to go.

Technical details of the synchronization process are documented inside
the script.
